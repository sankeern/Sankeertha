            A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library.
             Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships 
             with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts,
              as well as members’ subscriptions and profiles.
              Library management systems also involve maintaining the database for entering new books and 
            recording books that have been borrowed with their respective due dates.

                Library management software often includes, but is not limited to, the following features:

Data Management — Manages library data, which can include everything from assets to membership rosters.

Barcoding and RFID — Library management software usually provides barcoding and RFID capabilities. This enables patrons to conduct self check-in and check-out of borrowed materials and improves the efficiency with which the library is run.

Inventory Management — One of the most vital features that a library management software provides is the ability to manage all library inventory.

Asset Acquisition Management — A library is constantly expanding its collection to provide its users with a current slate of offerings. In order to do that, it must acquire new assets. This feature manages the asset acquisition process from sourcing to purchase and storage.

Circulation Management — Manages the books and other library assets that have been checked out and are currently in use by members.

Membership Fee Collection — Collects fees from members.

Additional Library Management Features
Mobility — Provides users with mobile access to the application, typically for library members.

Digital Asset Library Integration — As digital assets have increased in prevalence, so has the need to manage their cataloging and access. This feature covers the management of those digital assets.

Automated Cataloging — This feature handles the automatic cataloging of library assets, usually by using the RFID or barcode that’s been put on or attached to the asset.

Trends Related to Library Management Software
Cloud — In recent years, as in most industries, there has been a migration of library management solutions to the cloud. Cloud-based solutions are more flexible, easier to maintain, and accessible from anywhere.

Digital Transformation — Digital transformation has swept through the library industry, changing the way in which the library is run and its assets are managed. Libraries are now offering programs to introduce students to this concept, including programming languages and virtual reality. Library management software will be the centralized hub through which the programmatic offerings of libraries are managed.

Software and Services Related to Library Management Software
Accounting — Library management software typically integrates with accounting software to round out the financial functionality of the solutions.

Digital Content Providers — Library management applications often integrate with digital content providers, who can stock the library with digital assets. As digital assets become more desired by library members, it becomes increasingly important for libraries to maintain up-to-date content libraries. This is done through built-in integrations with providers of that content.
